                <h2>Overview and Methods</h2>
    
                <p>The Creative Independent is a resource of emotional and practical guidance for artists of all types. Our aim is to publish insights and wisdom that make it easier to sustain a fulfilling creative life. Throughout our work, we’ve seen how hard it can be to build such a life in the music industry—from how difficult it is for aspiring musicians to break through, to how even the most seasoned, respected musicians struggle to support themselves. But what, exactly, is bringing down the music industry—and what can be done to improve things?</p>

                <p>In October of 2019, The Creative Independent (TCI) co-authored two future-focused surveys—one for musicians, and one for music industry professionals—with musician and creator of the Future Music Industry list, René Kladzyk. By surveying the music community at large, we hoped to get a clearer sense of where things currently stand, in addition to identifying clear takeaways for how the industry can be improved.</p>

                <p>After collecting nearly 300 survey responses, we’ve analyzed the information and distilled it into 10 key findings, which we are presenting here. Alongside each key takeaway you’ll find a snapshot of the supporting data, plus write-in quotes from survey respondents.</p>

                <p>As a companion piece to this report, today we’re also publishing a guide written by René, called How to build the future music industry we want and need. While this report shares key findings from the surveys, René’s guide contextualizes the findings from her perspective, and offers additional thoughts on how each and every participant in the industry can come together to collectively build what’s next.</p>

                <p>Despite the somewhat stark nature of this report, we’re optimistic about where things can go if we all work together to create the change we want and need. We hope you are, too.</p>

                <p>— TCI and René</p>

                <h2>Who Participated In This Study?</h2>

                </div>

                <p>Overall, 298 musicians and music industry professionals shared insights through our surveys.</p>

                <p>There was a broad range of experience reflected, with over 41% of musicians and 33% of industry professionals having spent more than 10 years working in the industry. Participating industry professionals primarily reported working for record labels, as bookers or promoters, in music press or PR, and in artist services. 23% of industry professionals reported that they were also musicians, reflecting the crossover between performers and other industry roles.</p>

                <p>Survey respondents largely came from TCI’s readership and René’s Future Music Industry list contacts, and the broader circles of those who shared it from this initial pool. In order to ensure the privacy of participants, we did not collect any personally identifiable information (including gender, race, or income levels), and therefore cannot provide specific respondent demographic information. While we can’t say that these survey results accurately reflect the music industry as a whole, we believe they provide a snapshot of the current state of the industry, and shed light on many of the most pressing challenges that must be addressed.</p>

                <p>In an era where musicians are primarily earning music-related income through performance fees, it’s clear that most are unable to support themselves by touring alone. And, while industry professionals see opportunities for musicians to make money through publishing and branded content, musicians do not appear to be reaping the benefits of those income generators.</p>

                        <li>⬤ Over two thirds of musicians reported that music-related earnings accounted for 0% – 20% of their income. This is among an experienced group of participants: 70% of musicians had been working in the music industry for over 5 years, and 41% for over 10 years.</li>
                        <li>⬤ Just 12% of musicians reported that 80% – 100% of their income came from music-related work.</li>
                        <li>⬤ When asked about the ways they’d primarily been able to make money through their music, “performing/touring” was by far musicians’ top choice.</li>
                        <li>⬤ Musicians and industry professionals disagree about how musicians can best earn money: When asked about the most lucrative ways for a musician to generate music-related income, the greatest percentage (66%) of industry professionals thought that syncs, licensing, and publishing were lucrative methods to generate income, and 55% thought one of the top ways would be through sponsored or branded content. However, only 19% of musicians reported that syncs, licensing, or publishing was one of the primary ways they’d been able to make money, and just 4% reported that branded or sponsored content was a primary money-earner.</li>

                <p>Since the vast majority of musicians cannot earn a living wage through music-related work, those without financial privilege are left without a way to sustain their participation.

                <p>Across the board, the music community asserts that the unfairness inherent in streaming services’ payment models and content curation perpetuates unfairness overall, and creates a negative ripple effect across the entire industry. Many respondents suggested that putting collective pressure on services such as Spotify to pay artists fairly, and investing in more cooperative models for distributing music, would help.</p>

                    <p>“Streaming services could be designed in a way that values creative labor more highly, encourages album listening, algorithmically counters racism and sexism instead of reinforcing it, and encourages listeners to buy music and attend upcoming concerts.”</p>

                <h2>Key finding 08: The music industry is (still) controlled by a gatekeeper class.</h2>

                <p>Although digital platforms have enabled musicians to take the distribution of their work into their own hands, gatekeepers—such as press, bookers, and labels—still play a leading role in the growth of an artist’s career. Because of this, music writers, bookers, promoters, and publishers have a responsibility to be accountable for who they give opportunities to, and why. This includes remodeling behavior to avoid back-room deals and nepotism.</p>

Relationships with mentors, collaborators, band mates, and friends are often how musicians find opportunities; however, it’s yet another place where nepotism creeps in. Opening access to mentorship opportunities and other types of industry relationships would directly help to level the playing field.</p>
