                <h2>Overview and Methods</h2>
    
                <p>The Creative Independent is a resource of emotional and practical guidance for artists of all types. Our aim is to publish insights and wisdom that make it easier to sustain a fulfilling creative life. Throughout our work, we’ve seen how hard it can be to build such a life in the music industry—from how difficult it is for aspiring musicians to break through, to how even the most seasoned, respected musicians struggle to support themselves. But what, exactly, is bringing down the music industry—and what can be done to improve things?</p>

                <p>In October of 2019, The Creative Independent (TCI) co-authored <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/help-us-build-the-future-music-industry-we-want-and-need/">two future-focused surveys</a>—one for musicians, and one for music industry professionals—<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/help-us-build-the-future-music-industry-we-want-and-need/">with musician and creator of the Future Music Industry list, René Kladzyk</a>. By surveying the music community at large, we hoped to get a clearer sense of where things currently stand, in addition to identifying clear takeaways for how the industry can be improved.</p>

                <p>After collecting nearly 300 survey responses, we’ve analyzed the information and distilled it into 10 key findings, which we are presenting here. Alongside each key takeaway you’ll find a snapshot of the supporting data, plus write-in quotes from survey respondents.</p>

                <p>As a companion piece to this report, today we’re also publishing a guide written by René, called <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/help-us-build-the-future-music-industry-we-want-and-need/"><i>How to build the future music industry we want and need</i></a>. While this report shares key findings from the surveys, René’s guide contextualizes the findings from her perspective, and offers additional thoughts on how each and every participant in the industry can come together to collectively build what’s next.</p>

                <p>Despite the somewhat stark nature of this report, we’re optimistic about where things can go if we all work together to create the change we want and need. We hope you are, too.</p>

                <p>Overall, 298 musicians and music industry professionals shared insights through our surveys.</p>

                <p>There was a broad range of experience reflected, with over 41% of musicians and 33% of industry professionals having spent more than 10 years working in the industry. Participating industry professionals primarily reported working for record labels, as bookers or promoters, in music press or PR, and in artist services. 23% of industry professionals reported that they were also musicians, reflecting the crossover between performers and other industry roles.</p>

                <p>Survey respondents largely came from TCI’s readership and René’s Future Music Industry list contacts, and the broader circles of those who shared it from this initial pool. In order to ensure the privacy of participants, we did not collect any personally identifiable information (including gender, race, or income levels), and therefore cannot provide specific respondent demographic information. While we can’t say that these survey results accurately reflect the music industry as a whole, we believe they provide a snapshot of the current state of the industry, and shed light on many of the most pressing challenges that must be addressed.</p>

                <p>In an era where musicians are primarily earning music-related income through performance fees, it’s clear that most are unable to support themselves by touring alone. And, while industry professionals see opportunities for musicians to make money through publishing and branded content, musicians do not appear to be reaping the benefits of those income generators.</p>

                    <h3>Data Snapshot:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Over two thirds of musicians reported that music-related earnings accounted for 0% – 20% of their income. This is among an experienced group of participants: 70% of musicians had been working in the music industry for over 5 years, and 41% for over 10 years.</li>
                        <li>Just 12% of musicians reported that 80% – 100% of their income came from music-related work.</li>
                        <li>When asked about the ways they’d primarily been able to make money through their music, “performing/touring” was by far musicians’ top choice.</li>
                        <li>Musicians and industry professionals disagree about how musicians can best earn money: When asked about the most lucrative ways for a musician to generate music-related income, the greatest percentage (66%) of industry professionals thought that syncs, licensing, and publishing were lucrative methods to generate income, and 55% thought one of the top ways would be through sponsored or branded content. However, only 19% of musicians reported that syncs, licensing, or publishing was one of the primary ways they’d been able to make money, and just 4% reported that branded or sponsored content was a primary money-earner.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Since the vast majority of musicians cannot earn a living wage through music-related work, those without financial privilege are left without a way to sustain their participation. Similarly, music industry professionals suffer from insufficient earnings. Despite this dire funding landscape, many still continue to pursue a career in the music industry.</p>

                        <li>Just 17% of musicians and 33% of industry professionals reported that they were “always able to pay their bills each month.”</li>
                        <li>37% of musicians reported that they were barely able to pay their bills, or actively in debt.</li>

                <h2>In Conclusion...</h2>

                <p>As the data clearly shows, the music industry faces significant challenges that must be addressed head-on in order to build a better future. While this will be hard work, respondents conveyed a sense of optimism that momentum is building around solving these problems.</p>

                <p>In our last question to survey respondents, we asked them to share the most encouraging things they’d seen happening in today’s industry. In closing, we’d like to share a few responses that shout out the people, organizations, and projects that are paving the way for a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable music industry.</p>
